# Introduction to Linear Algebra

This repo contains my attempt to code the maths behind Linear Algebra as I study the book
Introduction to Linear Algebra by Prof. Gilbert Strang. Linear Algebra plays a very central
role in many streams of Computer Science, and hence I felt it is important to understand how
to code the Linear Algebra formulas and operations.

The code is implemented on python and makes use of numpy package to work with vectors. 
I have tried to implement everything in a raw manner, as well as using numpy. 

This is still a work in progress. I will keep adding more chapters as I keep progressing.
